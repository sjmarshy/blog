I really enjoy the process of writing, and it's fantastic for coming up with new ideas. The problem is that it's dead easy to get distracted by everything else - unfortunately, things like writing and drawing are at a tangent to my every day life if I just let everything sort itself out. At the end of the day, letting what I spend my time doing just shake out by itself doesn't work.

Having said that, this is the longest I've kept a blog up, and I've been writing way more in general recently. The question that comes out of that, then, is how have I been making it work? 

As usual with these things, this answer is very personal so I don't know if any of this would work for anyone else. But, regardless - I'll set it out as much as I understand it.

I think step one with it is that I [started small](http://blog.andymatuschak.org/post/169043084412/successful-habits-through-smoothly-ratcheting), and have been moving forward in [small steps](https://blog.sjm.computer/201803011843). I've found that starting too big is frequently in lists [of common mistakes](https://blog.beeminder.com/tao2/). It seems obvious, but there's definitely a reason it ends up in one of these lists. It's so easy to try and 'just go for it' when you're at the height of your own insistance that you want to do something new.

The fact of the matter is I don't *need* to write a lot, I just need to write at all. If it's important that you write huge volumes, then it might not work - but then again, a little bit but more often might be enough. I've talked about [incremental improvement](https://blog.sjm.computer/201804071643) before, and this is an extension of that idea

I've been tracking this writing habit using [beeminder](https://www.beeminder.com), which is just the sort of thing that beeminder is for. It's 'a tool for tracking and encouraging certain behaviours - and punishing not performing the behaviours'. This is 'giving your goal teeth' - for me the idea of it costing me isn't the biggest motivation, but it kind of provides a baseline 'oh, go on then' push that actually helps loads.

One of the more hugely helpful things that beeminder does for me is *reminding me that my goal exists*. These intents are made by long-term me, and almost always forgotten by short-term me. It's nice to get a reminder that a goal exists as it aproaches the top my list. I think this is my favourite part, especially for longer-running or more infrequent goals. I'm a forgetful sort of person.

Essentially, all this is to say that I [have a system](https://jamesclear.com/goals-systems?__s=uubdhytai572sfiaxyzw). I always end up saying that [rigid systems fail](http://calnewport.com/blog/2013/01/13/write-every-day-is-bad-advice-hacking-the-psychology-of-big-projects/) - but it's true! You really do need 'a strategy that bends and not breaks'. I build up my ideas [bit by bit over time](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/manage-writing-ideas/). It works for me, and at the end of the day - it's all about whatever works!
