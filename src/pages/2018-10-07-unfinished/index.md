The purpose of my blog is to put my thoughts out there. Pretty simple, I imagine it's a pretty common purpose for blogs to have. I believe that new ideas come from context and other people's ideas. And that even sticking my own unfinished ideas on a blog might contribute to somebody else's great idea. It's even possible that somebody else could be me in the future.

This plays nicely into my ideas about [things being incremental](https://blog.sjm.computer/201804071643). [Incremental thought, maybe](https://blog.sjm.computer/201804292022). It began as "by writing things down, especially the incomplete stuff, I can come back and build on it later". It's become "If I publish these unfinished thoughts, others can come and find them - and maybe finish them themselves". There's the added bonus that this works for any number of people. Everyone would likely find a new way to finish a thought - figure out [their own connections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_(philosophy_of_education)). By publishing things, I don't take away from myself and I potentially help others.

For this reason (and, I'm sure, some others), guarding your ideas doesn't help anyone. We all combine thoughts differently anyway. By letting the thought go somewhere I know I can find it again, I can [move on to new thoughts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeigarnik_effect).

This is far from a new idea. Open source is exactly this but for software. There's most likely some form of this thought present in a large number of publications from the past several centuries too. It touches on Brian Eno's concept of [scenius](https://austinkleon.com/2017/05/12/scenius/), and even Newton stood on the shoulders of giants. I probably need all this confirmation and similarity to give me the courage to keep publishing my thoughts. 

And hey, maybe I'll improve my writing while I'm at it.
