It's been nice recently, as I feel like I've been making progress even at times when I haven't done very much. I've been capturing ideas & drawing & writing in a kind of natural flow that I trust to keep moving forward. The trust is the most important part of this process - once I capture an idea in my notebook, my mind can let go of it knowing that it'll get delt with later.

I don't need to do much, I just need to do that little bit consistently.
