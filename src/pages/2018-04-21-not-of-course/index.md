I have a nasty habit of saying 'of course' when things aren't obvious to anyone, sometimes even me. Something like 'of course, doing this part first is important'. Similarly to the word [just](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/just/), this can only make people feel like they should already have known something. Like they are somehow lesser, when this is not the case at all. It probably gives people second thoughts about me too, if they notice it.

I've been paying attention to my word choices more, pushing myself to word things differently without this little phrase. This is a public record of that effort. If you know me, and notice me use the words 'of course' about something that isn't obvious, please give me a gentle reminder!
