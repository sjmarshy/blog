Turns out that one of my favourite metaphors for Software Development, organic growth, works pretty well for ideas and creativity too.

If you think about where to plant your ideas (external representations - I use [zettels](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/)) and how to feed them (connections between thoughts) then they're more likely to grow and develop fruit and other cheesy metaphor stuff.

Sure, if you let the seeds fly about and do what they want, some stuff will grow - but why leave it to chance?

Any other [favourite metaphors](https://blog.sjm.computer/201804071643) for me to mess up? Let me know!
