My style of writing poetry has almost certainly been influenced by being a software developer. I find that I use indentation a lot, and punctuation very little. I find that I have a habit of indenting
both for structure - concepts which are related get indented together - and for aesthetics. Human language
and computer language can definitely stand pretty closely.

As an example, a few poems I've written:

## Pay Attention:

```text
Pay Attention
Spend your attention on me
Put your attention into
A little piggy bank
  A tithe to the day
          to productivity
  I’ll collect it once a month
```

</br>

## Small Steps:

```text
Can I sit up, write the date?
Can I take a small step heading
    in the direction I want to take?
```

</br>

## Metaphors:

```text
Open your door
Walk your son
  Down the road
Push him out there
  And go back in  
How many sons do we push?
That’s a metaphor.
My life is over-stretching
  My shoulders
  My metaphors
```

Every piece of a person goes into every other piece, I guess. If you’re a programmer who writes poetry, expect the poetry to influence your code and your code to influence your poetry.

This whole idea inspired by a [tweet by @maybekatz](https://twitter.com/maybekatz/status/961621597319671808). I'm not sure I've done with the idea yet, either...
