Sometimes I write down daft ideas designed to help no-one. I thought I'd put some of my favourites up here:

## 01

Struggling to come up with a password? Ask your enemies for ideas, they'll think of stuff you never would

## 02

Got a favourite tv series? Have a friend watch any new episodes first and tell you anything interesting or exciting that happens, so you don't get too surprised

## 03

Have two shirts you like? Why not sew them together to make one amazing shirt you can share with a friend

## 04

If you're tired of paying student loans, try earning less

## 05

Don't like adverts? You might be a communist! Check out the works of Karl Marx
