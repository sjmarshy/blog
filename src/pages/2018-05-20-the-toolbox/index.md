Software is rarely just 'good' or 'bad'. It's more complicated then that. There are usually so many different dimensions that it's hard to nail any project down to one word. Software can be effective but hard to maintain, or it might be easy to make a change but the final package might be half a gigabyte in size. There are often too many dimensions to take into account at one time, and must tackle them one at a time instead.

There's a bunch of ways to write software. It's rare for those ways themselves to be good or bad. It can even be hard to write about 'good' or 'bad' software, as there are so many aspects to take account of. Often, it's a combination of context and how the approaches ate applied that makes them effective or not. I think it's important to understand that, even for an exact situation, there is no Right approach. There is only 'appropriate'. Believing in a Right approach leads to fighting with other developers, ignoring alternate approaches, and being pretty up yourself.

Having your own toolbox helps. Having different things to try makes a huge difference here. Each new tool adds further choice, and also more knowledge of when to use each of your other tools. Not every codebase needs to use every tool in your toolbox, but having the option to swap one approach out for the other is huge.

- having access to a lot of different techniques and patterns is an amazingly powerful thing that can lead to great code
    - not every codebase needs every technique, effort should be put into evaluating each tool in the current context
        - it's also okay to change approach. To remove one approach and instead use an other after some issue has been identified.
    - a good codebase is organic, and can handle these shifts and changes with ease
    - most codebases will use many of your approaches
- look after your toolbox. Try to get rid of broken tools that don't work well, try to add new tools whenever you can, try to treasure your old faithful tools and don't forget about them
    - it's a balance
