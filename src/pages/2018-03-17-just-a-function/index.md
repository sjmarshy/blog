One of my favourite quotes is by [John Carmack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Carmack):

    "Sometimes the most elegant implementation is just a function.
     Not a method, not a class. Not a framework. Just a function"

I've been thinking about it a bunch recently. I got a new job last month, and the codebase is the most [Object Oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) that I've worked on (after coming from the most [Functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)), and it's been a fascinating experience. This isn't a case of "I wish everything was done the way I'd do it". I don't roll like that. In fact, Carmack's quote cuts both ways. Sometimes an Object-with-a-capital-O is the most graceful representation - even in a functional codebase. Depending on your language, this might be less true - but typeclasses in Haskell or Protocols in clojure aren't a million miles off.

A good way to see it is that everything is just another [tool in your bag](/201805281342), there's no need for a turf war. Personally, mutation and inheritence still terrify me, I find them so hard to follow and genuinely believe in their alternatives. But I'm always open to seeing new ways of implementing things, and I love working my way through different approaches. This whole train of thought started before even the new job, when looking through the implementation of [Folktale](http://folktale.origamitower.com/), which is all about those prototypes. I'm still wrestling this whole thing, but it's another internal triumph for pragmatism.
