One of my favourite quotes is by [John Carmack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Carmack):

    "Sometimes the most elegant implementation is just a function.
     Not a method, not a class. Not a framework. Just a function"

I've been thinking about it a bunch recently. I got a new job last month, and the codebase is the most [Object Oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) that I've worked on (after coming from the most [Functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)), and it's been a fascinating experience. This isn't a case of "I wish everything was done the way I'd do it". I don't roll like that. In fact, Carmacks quote cuts both ways. Sometimes an Object-with-a-capital-O is the most graceful representation - even in a functional codebase (This depends on your language of course).

A good way to see it is that everything is just another tool in your bag, there's no need for a turf war. Personally, mutation and inheritence still terrify me, I find them so hard to follow and genuinely believe in their alternatives. But I'm always open to seeing new ways of implementing things, and love seeing the different approaches. This whole train of thought started before even the new job, when looking through the implementation of [Folktale](http://folktale.origamitower.com/), which is all about those prototypes. I'm still wrestling this whole thing, but it's another internal triumph for pragmatism.
