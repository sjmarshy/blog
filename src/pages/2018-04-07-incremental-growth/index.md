Hopefully, none of this sounds *too* self-helpey.

In my experience, growth doesn't happen in big steps. Instead, it happens a little bit at  a time. Any movement 'forward' is growth, in fact, and should be celebrated. Sometimes, other people look  like they're making huge leaps  forward, but I'm willing to bet that's an outside perspective on lots of little steps forward, gathered together and unleashed by one final little burst.

This is expressed in a different way by Carl Jung:

> Lifes major problems cannot be solved, they can  only be outgrown

For me, the use  of the word 'outgrown' sparks images of organic processes, nature, plants. I don't want to do the classic 'trees can crack pavements' thing, but when looked at this way it's hard to accept growth as anything other than a gradual, incremental process.

I've been thinking about an incremental appraoch to things for a long time, and this is a sort of checkpoint for me. an affirmation that I still believe in this idea. It's still true, for me. 

It brings me hope and energy to think that I never need to do a whole thing - a part of something gets me a long way. Usually this means that the thing is closer to being finished - which makes it less intimidating - when the alternative would be unstarted.

This whole idea is also related to [micro habits](https://stephenguise.com/the-path-to-consistent-exercise/). This is something I'm reading more about recently, but it's definitely an interesting idea to me. I still have a long way to go with my thinking about this approach, and there's lots still to learn - but I regularly make small steps forward, so I guess it's all good. It still amazes me what this change in perspective can bring
