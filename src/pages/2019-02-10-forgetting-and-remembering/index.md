# Forgetting and remembering - a metaphor

Forgetting something and then later working your way back to it is like [wayfinding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayfinding), which is interesting all by itself. [The more signposts and roads we place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_(philosophy_of_education)), the less likely that our memory will disappear.

[This article about how we might encode this information](https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-brain-maps-out-ideas-and-memories-like-spaces-20190114/) seems to say this is more than just a metaphor - that the encoding mechanism we use for physical space may be the same as the one we use for concepts. Our mental way-finding maps may exist after all. Which sort of makes sense, itâ€™s unlikely we have dozens of different ways of storing and retrieving information when one general one would do. We understand so little about ourselves on this level, though.

Sometimes, [metaphors](https://blog.sjm.codes/201806071745) are more than just correspondence, they can be useful in [how we model](/models-vs-metaphors), store or use data.
