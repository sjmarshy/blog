Success! I've got a little microservice that just occasionally pokes at my [`/wordcount`](/wordcount) page and then submits the subsequent request to beeminder. Nice.

I'd probably make it a slightly more macro-service if I needed anything else deploying - at the moment, it's taking up one of my slots for an instance on `now` for something it does once an hour

but for now, that's cool
