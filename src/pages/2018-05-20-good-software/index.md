Software is rarely just 'good' or 'bad', the situation is more complicated then that. There are usually so many different aspects that it's hard to reduce to a single word. Software can be effective but unmaintainable. It might be easy to make a change but the final package might be half a gigabyte in size. There are often too many dimensions to take into account at once, so they must be tackled one at a time instead.
